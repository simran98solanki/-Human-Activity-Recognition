# Analyzing Human Activities Using Smartphone Data - Python
In this hospital patient recovery monitoring project, I spearheaded the identification of patient actions like walking, sitting, lying, and climbing using sensor data from smartphones and the environment. Through Python, I conducted data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and implemented machine learning classifiers and LSTM deep learning models. The outcome was the creation of the Ultimate Human Activity Recognition Model, accurately predicting activities such as Walking, Sitting, and Standing. By evaluating various models and optimizing for accuracy, I contributed to enhancing patient care in hospitals through efficient monitoring systems. Additionally, I played a role in designing a website to present project findings effectively, showcasing insights and model capabilities for real-world healthcare applications.
